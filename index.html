<li>College Prep Math Topics</td><td class=b><p class=t2>Course Description:<p>What is the fewest number of colors needed to color the map of Africa? How can you determine who is the best football team in the nation? What is the shortest and fastest route between Denver and Seattle if you consider speed limits? These are some of the intriguing questions that will be explored in this applications-based course. The emphasis in this course is on the use of problem-solving and critical-thinking skills for everyday situations - or practical dilemmas. In addition, this course will review topics as needed for college placement exams.  Recognizing that most four year colleges desire incoming students to have completed a math sequence through Algebra II, Discrete Math is recommended to college-bound students who have already passed Algebra II. However, it is possible to take Discrete Math instead of Algebra 2.</p></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2 ><img width=10% src='https://cdnsm5-ss18.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_199481/Image/VIKING_LOGO.jpg'/></th></tr></table>"
