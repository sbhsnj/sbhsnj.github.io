This rigorous course requires total commitment from its members. Students participate in the entire yearbook production process from theme and concept development to final delivery and distribution. Each student will be responsible for specific aspects of producing the yearbook including writing and editing stories, proofreading, photography, creating layouts, publishing, and promoting sales of dedication pages and the yearbook. It is essential that students selecting this class meet and maintain copy preparation deadlines imposed by the publisher. Failure to make deadlines will result in a drastically reduced grade and possible failure for the marking period and/or the course. Because of the enormity of this commitment, all students must make the yearbook their number one extra-curricular activity and be available for mandatory after-school meetings on designated dates. Students will receive instruction from the assigned art teacher and use Adobe InDesign and Photoshop to digitally layout and design the yearbook. Training for these programs will be provided, but potential staff members could benefit by taking the Desktop Publishing and/or Photoshop classes prior to applying for this course.</p></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2 ><img width=10% src='https://cdnsm5-ss18.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_199481/Image/VIKING_LOGO.jpg'/></th></tr></table>"

It is designed for students with an interest in science, biology, medicine or a related field. Advanced Placement Biology is laboratory-oriented, with an extraordinary amount of home study required. This course prepares students for the Advanced Placement Examination.
Advanced Placement Biology stresses college-level academics on a wide range of subject matter such as cell physiology, biochemistry, metabolism, respiration, photosynthesis, genetics, and animal anatomy and physiology. While students in Advanced Placement Biology study many of the topics of Biology I, they proceed with greater independence of thought and develop a great deal more insight into the realm of biology by engaging in a more rigid, more sophisticated approach to the topic under study. The overall instructional strategy approach is that of a first-year college biology course with a strong emphasis on labs. Labs have a ""Design your Own"" component that is emphasized in the college board curriculum. The curriculum is aligned with the topics required by the College Board for the Advanced Placement Biology Exam. This course uses texts that are used in Colleges and Universities. The student grades are based upon a sophisticated summer assignment, tests, homework, laboratory reports and student-driven analysis and application of the concepts taught.

In AP African American Studies, students explore key topics that extend from early African kingdoms to the ongoing challenges and achievements of the contemporary moment. Given the interdisciplinary character of African American Studies, students in the course will develop skills across multiple fields, with an emphasis on developing historical, literary, visual and data analysis skills. This course foregrounds a study of the diversity of Black communities in the United States within the broader context of Africa and the African diaspora.

Students are encouraged to understand what they learn and apply this learning to their own experiences. Activities utilized include classroom demonstrations and experiments, audio-visual presentations and out of class projects. Videos shown in this course may include Memento and Girl Interrupted.           

Note: Students may take Advanced Placement Psychology upon completion of this course; however, one must meet the prerequisites listed in that course&apos;s description. Keep in mind that Advanced Placement Psychology is much more rigorous and demanding. Advanced Placement Psychology covers additional content, includes statistics, requires research studies to be conducted throughout the year, and requires the completion of a summer assignment before the start of the school year.</p></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2 ><img width=10% src='https://cdnsm5-ss18.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_199481/Image/VIKING_LOGO.jpg'/></th></tr></table>"
